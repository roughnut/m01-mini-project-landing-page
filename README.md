# Bootcamp Module 1 Mini Project

Under construction landing page

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice the HTML and CSS skills learned in Week 1 of USYD Coding Bootcamp run by eDX.

In particular to build a site using semantic HTML and basic CSS display properties. More advanced CSS (e.g. Flexbox) will be learned in Week 2.

The contact form element of the project was built using self-taught methods. I used Github copilot and ChatGPT to learn HTML form syntax and CSS properties, but did not use the AI to build it for me.

I taught myself how to use \<figure>, \<figcaption>, \<form>, \<label>, and \<input> elements (both the type="text" & type="submit")

The more difficult elements involved fixing the header to the top of the viewport and aligning the form's label and input elements.
